# Ledger Immutability Rules

- Posted journal entries cannot be updated or deleted.
- Corrections occur via reversals and/or new correcting entries.
- Services must enforce balanced entries.
- Every ledger mutation must be tested:
  - posting immutability
  - reversal correctness
  - balancing invariant
