# New Workflow Playbook

1) Create definition.yaml with states, events, guards, transitions.
2) Implement guards in code (config + code guards).
3) Ensure engine validation covers this workflow.
4) Ensure optimistic locking and idempotency are honored.
5) Add tests: happy path + failure paths + override path.
6) Add projection updates for rm_* summary tables.
