# Dimensions and Segmentation

Dimensions are first-class reference data.

Minimum required:
- Site
- Cost Center
- Business Unit

Rules:
- Dimensions are validated everywhere
- Referenced by ID only
- Ledger lines always include dimensions
- Reporting and projections depend on them

This enables:
- Multi-site operations
- Cost accounting
- Owner vs corporate separation
